# Solar-System-in-Python-Turtle
Simulates a solar system in python using the turtle module. You can add as many stars and planets as required by calling classes

The file solarsystem.py is where the main code sits. The values in this code need not be changed, all the classes and libraries are initialised in this file.
The file SimpleSolarSystem.py is where the actual simulation is run. This is where u call your classes and change the parameters of the bodies.
